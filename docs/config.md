## Logo

The `logo` config field is a child of the `ui` field and is used to define logo display and position on the map. The optional `smallScreenPosition` and `largeScreenPosition` subfields also allow for fine tuning of the logo position. These values will override the default positioning.

If a config file does not contain a `logo` field, no logo will be displayed on the map.

A new folder has been added `front-end/public/assets/logo` as a central store for logo images.

The `logo` field has 6 subfields

- `largeLogo`: the location of the large logo image e.g.: `/assets/logos/cwm-logo.png`
- `smallLogo`: similar to above, the location of the small logo
- `altText`: any alt text to be associated with the logo
- `smallScreenPosition`: position of the logo on small screens, defined with CSS position properties (top, left)
- `largeScreenPosition`: position of the logo on large screens, defined with CSS position properties (bottom, right)

### Example of the `logo` config field for **CWM**

```
"ui": {
  "logo": {
    "largeLogo": "/assets/logos/cwm-logo.png",
    "smallLogo": "/assets/logos/cwm-logo-small.png",
    "altText": "Cooperative World Map",
    "smallScreenPosition": {
      "top": "0",
      "left": "5px"
    },
    "largeScreenPosition": {
      "bottom": "-25px",
      "right": "-5px"
    }
  }
},
```

## Map

The `map` config field is also a child of the `ui` field and is used to define the boundaries of a map. If a config contains no `map` field, the whole of the world map will be displayed by default, Ã  la the **CWM**.

The `map` field has 1 subfield

- `mapBounds`: an array the countains the longitude and latitude of the map's boundaries

### The `map` config object including the **Powys** map boundaries

```
"ui": {
  "map": {
    "mapBounds": [
      [-5.5, 51.3],
      [-2.5, 53.5]
    ]
  }
},
```

### The `ui` field including the `directory_panel_field`, `filterableFields`, `map` and `logo` child fields

```
"ui": {
  "directory_panel_field": "country_id",
  "filterableFields": [
    "country_id",
    "primary_activity",
    "organisational_structure",
    "typology"
  ],
  "map": {
    "mapBounds": [
      [-5.5, 51.3],
      [-2.5, 53.5]
    ]
  },
