# mykomap-server

This directory contains a fastify plugin that was autogenerated using
[fastify-openapi-glue](https://github.com/seriousme/fastify-openapi-glue) and
the OpenApi specifation in [openApi.json](openApi.json)

In this directory use:

- `npm install` to install its dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode, with vite-node for hot module replacement
- `npm build` to transpile the server to javascript in dist/server.js
- `npm start` to start the built server for running as a service
- `npm test` to run the tests

note: the auto generated test scaffolding does not contain any data yet !

In all cases, the server mounts the API at the top-level path, unless
the plug-in is passed a the `prefix` option when registering it.

You may want to set an environment variable `SERVER_DATA_ROOT` to
define the path to find the canned data on. It defaults to `data`,
which does not exist by default, but setting it to
`SERVER_DATA_ROOT=test/data` will make it use the dummy data packaged
for the tests. Of course, you can supply another directory and your own data.

Alternatively this option can be set via the API plugin's option
`serviceOptions.dataRoot`.
